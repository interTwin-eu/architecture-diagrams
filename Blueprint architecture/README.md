# interTwin

interTwin is an EU-funded project to co-design and implement the prototype of an interdisciplinary *Digital Twin Engine* (*DTE*) – an open-source platform based on open standards that can integrate with application-specific *Digital Twins* (*DTs*).

Its functional specifications and implementation are based on a co-designed interoperability framework and conceptual model of a DT for research – the DTE blueprint architecture.

A *DT* is a real-time digital representation of a physical object, process, system, or entity. This concept has been widely used in manufacturing, energy, healthcare, physics, astronomy, environment science, and many others to enhance efficiency, predict issues, and simulate different scenarios without impacting the actual physical entity.

A *Blueprint architecture* for a *DTE* refers to a structured template or guide that outlines how a *DT* platform or engine should be designed and constructed. This architecture details key components, relationships, processes, and other considerations necessary for building and operating *DTs* effectively.

While specific details may vary based on industry and purpose, a typical Blueprint architecture for a *DTE* might include:

1. **Real-time Data Input**: The *DT* feeds off data from the physical object. These include sensors, cameras, and other data-gathering devices.
2. **Connections and APIs**: Interconnections with other systems and platforms, allowing for data and functionalities integration.
3. **Processing Platform**: Where data analysis occurs, simulations are run, and behaviors are modeled.
4. **Data Storage**: Database solutions where both real-time and historical data are stored.
5. **Analysis and Simulation Module**: Tools and algorithms that allow the simulation of different scenarios and extract valuable insights from the data.
6. **User Interface**: Visual tools and dashboards that allow users to interact with the *DT*, view data, and run simulations.
7. **Security and Privacy**: Components ensuring the protection of data and operations of the *DT*.
8. **Updates and Maintenance**: A system to keep the *DT* up-to-date and reflect changes in the physical object or system.
9. **Machine Learning and AI Modules**: Sometimes, *DTs* use machine learning or artificial intelligence to enhance predictions or automate decisions.
Governance and Management: Tools and protocols to manage the *DT*, ensure its proper operation, and make decisions based on its insights.

By following a Blueprint or architectural guide, organizations can ensure their digital twin implementation is consistent, scalable, and effective. We'll likely see further standardization and emerging best practices in this domain as this technology evolves.
